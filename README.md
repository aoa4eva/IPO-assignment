 


Check your mood

Listen to the question and think about an answer

Determine where the bathroom is in relation to your current location

Determine the manner and tone to use to communicate with the person asking the question.

If you are in a good mood

If you are not in a good mood

Determine the level of specificity the person asking the question will need - should I ask them to count steps, or will vague directions be enough? Tailor your output to the desired audience.

Determine the landmarks that should be used to identify if the user is on the right track, e.g. 

Customer Service, or the student lounge

Determine the landmarks that should be used to determine if the user has gone too far, e.g.

Room 408 (the room with a full-length glass window to the side)

Understand that gratitude has been expressed and respond accordingly
